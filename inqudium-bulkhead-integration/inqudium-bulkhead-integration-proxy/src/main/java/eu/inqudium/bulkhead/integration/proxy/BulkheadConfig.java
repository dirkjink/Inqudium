/**
 * Single point where Inqudium is configured for this example.
 *
 * <p>The configuration is identical to the function-based example: one bulkhead named
 * {@code orderBh}, the {@code balanced} preset overridden to two concurrent permits. The
 * configuration code does not change between integration styles — the runtime is the same;
 * only the wiring on top differs. This module exercises the same runtime through a JDK
 * dynamic proxy rather than by wrapping method references at the call site.
 *
 * <p>The bulkhead is configured to emit acquire / release / reject / rollback events on its
 * per-component publisher (the four event types covered by sub-step&nbsp;6.D of
 * {@code REFACTORING_BULKHEAD_LOGGING_AND_RUNTIME_CONFIG.md}). The DSL default
 * ({@link BulkheadEventConfig#disabled()}) keeps the hot path event-free; the example opts
 * back in so the {@code DefaultOrderService}'s subscribers have something to log. The fifth
 * flag ({@code waitTrace}, gating {@code BulkheadWaitTraceEvent}) is intentionally left off
 * — the plan's decision&nbsp;4 enumerates four event types and
 * {@code BulkheadEventConfig.allEnabled()} would silently include the fifth.
