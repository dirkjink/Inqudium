/**
 * Tests for the proxy-based bulkhead example.
 *
 * <p>The tests exercise the example application — they use the same {@link OrderService}
 * interface, the same {@link DefaultOrderService} implementation, the same
 * {@link BulkheadConfig#newRuntime()} entry point, and the same
 * {@link InqPipeline#protect(Class, Object) pipeline.protect(...)} pattern that {@link Main}
 * demonstrates. The tests do not reach into bulkhead internals: assertions read
 * {@link InqBulkhead#availablePermits()}, the public handle accessor an application could
 * also consult.
 *
 * <p>The fixture is per-test: each {@code @Test} builds a fresh runtime, pipeline, factory,
 * and proxy in {@link #setUp()} and tears the runtime down in {@link #tearDown()}. The
 * lifecycle tests intentionally skip the fixture and build their own runtimes inside the
 * test method, since the property they pin is "two consecutive runtimes can be built and
 * closed in the same test class". They are flagged with their own setup notes.
