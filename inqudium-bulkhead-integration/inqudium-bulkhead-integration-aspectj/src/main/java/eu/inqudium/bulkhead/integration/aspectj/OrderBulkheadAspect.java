/**
 * Compile-time-woven aspect that protects every {@link eu.inqudium.annotation.InqBulkhead
 * @InqBulkhead}-annotated method with the bulkhead the annotation names.
 *
 * <p>Headline shape of the AspectJ-native pattern: the aspect owns the {@link InqRuntime},
 * builds an {@link InqPipeline} containing a bulkhead, and lifts the pipeline through a
 * {@link HybridAspectPipelineTerminal}. The terminal reads each woven method's return type
 * and dispatches sync methods through the {@code InqDecorator} chain and methods returning
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage} through the {@code InqAsyncDecorator} chain;
 * a single bulkhead instance therefore protects both shapes through one terminal.
 *
 * <h3>Annotation-driven resolution</h3>
 * <p>The pointcut binds the {@code @InqBulkhead} annotation as an advice parameter rather
 * than only matching its presence. The around-advice reads {@link
 * eu.inqudium.annotation.InqBulkhead#value() inqBulkhead.value()} on every invocation and
 * resolves the bulkhead by that name from the runtime's registry. A {@link ConcurrentMap}
 * caches one terminal per bulkhead name, so a given name is looked up and lifted into a
 * pipeline exactly once for the JVM's lifetime; subsequent invocations reuse the cached
 * terminal. This shape scales to multiple bulkheads with no additional code — a method
 * annotated {@code @InqBulkhead("orderBh")} and another annotated {@code @InqBulkhead(
 * "shippingBh")} would each end up routed through their own cached terminal — and makes
 * the dependence on the annotation's {@code value()} explicit at the dispatch surface.
 *
 * <p>The aspect is an AspectJ singleton — by default {@code ajc} weaves an
 * {@code aspectOf()} accessor and constructs exactly one instance per classloader on first
 * use. The constructor allocates the runtime; the runtime lives for the lifetime of the
 * aspect (effectively the JVM's). For an example/demo this is acceptable, and matches what
 * a 2026 application would write when it owns its own AspectJ wiring without a DI container.
 * In production with Spring or another container, the runtime would normally be a managed
 * bean injected into the aspect — see the Spring Framework and Spring Boot example modules
 * for that pattern.
 *
 * <h3>Why a hybrid terminal, not {@code AbstractPipelineAspect}</h3>
 * <p>{@link eu.inqudium.aspect.pipeline.AbstractPipelineAspect} is sync-only: its layer
 * providers ({@link eu.inqudium.aspect.pipeline.ElementLayerProvider}) decline async methods,
 * so async {@code @InqBulkhead}-annotated methods would slip through unprotected if the
 * aspect extended the sync base class. {@link HybridAspectPipelineTerminal} is the supported
 * hybrid surface: one composed pipeline, sync/async dispatch by return type, both halves
 * sharing one permit pool. Its Javadoc shows the exact pattern used here.
 *
 * <h3>Logging responsibilities</h3>
 * <p>Two operability concerns live in this aspect (sub-step&nbsp;6.E of
 * {@code REFACTORING_BULKHEAD_LOGGING_AND_RUNTIME_CONFIG.md}):
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Bulkhead-event subscription.</b> The constructor subscribes per-component
 *       handlers on the bulkhead's event publisher — TRACE for acquire/release, WARN for
 *       reject, ERROR for rollback. The aspect is the natural locus: it owns the runtime
 *       and the bulkhead handle. The function-based example does this in {@code OrderService};
 *       the proxy-based example does it in {@code DefaultOrderService}; the AspectJ idiom
 *       keeps the service plain and lifts the subscription into the aspect that already
 *       holds every reference it needs.</li>
 *   <li><b>Once-per-method topology logging.</b> The aspect knows the bulkhead and the
 *       chain-id, but not which methods its pointcut will eventually match — pointcut
 *       resolution is lazy, at the first join-point hit per method. A
 *       {@link ConcurrentHashMap} therefore gates a one-shot topology log per
 *       {@link Method}; topology lines appear spread across the early demo runtime rather
 *       than all at once before phase 1 starts. This is the structural deviation from the
 *       plan's decision&nbsp;3 (topology logged in {@code OrderService}'s constructor) that
 *       the AspectJ idiom forces — the service is plain Java with no reference to the
 *       aspect, so it cannot log topology itself.</li>
 * </ul>

     * Caches one {@link HybridAspectPipelineTerminal} per bulkhead name.

     * name returns the same instance. This cache, however, sits one layer above and holds
     * the {@code Pipeline+Terminal} object built around that bulkhead, which is decidedly
     * not free to reconstruct (see {@code HybridAspectPipelineTerminal}'s constructor):
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>walks the pipeline and reverses it to outermost-first order,</li>
     *   <li>validates every element via {@code instanceof}/cast against
     *       {@link eu.inqudium.core.pipeline.InqDecorator} <em>and</em>
     *       {@link eu.inqudium.imperative.core.pipeline.InqAsyncDecorator},</li>
     *   <li>allocates two layer-action arrays, including one bound
     *       {@code asyncDec::executeAsync} method reference per element,</li>
     *   <li>creates a {@code ResolvedPipelineState} with a fresh {@code chainId} — the
     *       identity anchor that diagnostic tooling uses to recognize the same pipeline
     *       across calls,</li>
     *   <li>allocates a per-{@link java.lang.reflect.Method} sync/async-flag cache that the
     *       terminal documents as the very thing that keeps its hot path cheap.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Without a cache at this layer, every advised invocation would build a fresh
     * pipeline and terminal, repeat the validation loop, allocate new method references,
     * mint a new {@code chainId} (breaking diagnostic continuity), and start the async-flag
     * cache empty so the per-method lookup never hits. Building the terminal eagerly in the
     * constructor is also not an option here: the example demonstrates that the
     * {@code @InqBulkhead} annotation's {@code value()} drives the resolution, which means
     * the set of names is, in principle, only known at advice time. {@link
     * java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap#computeIfAbsent computeIfAbsent} therefore
     * materializes one terminal per name on first use and reuses it forever after — the
     * shape that {@code HybridAspectPipelineTerminal}'s hot-path assumptions actually rely
     * on.
